Sahara is a web app which seeks to connect readers with independent book stores in their local area, showing their stock, and offering the ability to purchase and reserve the book for local pickup.
Sahara was my final project for Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp, and was completed with three classmates from the course.
We built this app from the ground up in roughly two weeks using Ruby on Rails, implementing much of what we learned over the course.
